# collector-snmp
Fast, scalable SNMP collector with dynamic configurable outputs

## Why?

SNMP is weird. It's also very efficient and a great way to gather data. What this collector does is to collect and normalize SNMP data into JSON so it can be injected into whatever you want. Examples are elasticsearch and mongodb which are both very relevant tools. 

## Installation 

## Supported Outputs

* stdout
* elasticsearch
* mongodb
